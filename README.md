# The Mathematical Cavern Adventure

You're an explorer, You see!

We've come down to this quiet cave in search of the **Ancient Mathematical Artifact.** It's said to have mystical powers and intelligence beyond all current knowledge!

Find the Artifact, and bring it back from the dungeon! But watch out: There are several guardians that have been said to protect the shrines of this mystical, mathematical, maze . . .
